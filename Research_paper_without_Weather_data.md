| Predicting the Output of Solar Photovoltaic Panels in the Absence of Weather Data Using Only the Power Output of the Neighbouring Sites | LSTM, GRU, RNN, Transformer                  | Time series forecasting using past PV output from multiple sites | Transformer model generally performed best, although it is computationally intensive. LSTM and GRU also showed good performance for time-series data. |
| Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Using Simple Data-Driven Models Without Weather Data | Persistence, Polynomial models, ANN (ANN6, ANN10) | Data-driven models using historical PV power output for forecasting | Demonstrates that even simple models using only past generated power data can provide accurate forecasts, outperforming trivial persistence techniques. |
