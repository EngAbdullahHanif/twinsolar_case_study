### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This readme file provides an overview of the initial steps taken in our team project, focusing on the visualization aspect. As a team member responsible for visualization, I've explored and experimented with various tools to identify the most suitable platform for our project needs.

### Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
Our project aims to analyze solar PV energy production and weather data, focusing on identifying peak and low production periods, visualizing weather patterns, and assessing energy production gaps. 

The visualization component plays a crucial role in presenting data insights and findings to stakeholders effectively.

### Visualization Tool <a name="visualization-tool"></a>
Given the requirements and resources available, we've decided to utilize Tableau as our primary visualization tool. 

The university has provided us with a product activation key for Tableau Desktop, enabling us to leverage its powerful features for data visualization and analysis without any charges.

### Dashboard Creation <a name="dashboard-creation"></a>
To familiarize myself with Tableau Desktop and its capabilities, I've created a sample dashboard using mock data. 

While the dashboard content may not reflect the actual project data, it served as a valuable exercise to explore Tableau's functionalities.

### Publishing Methods <a name="publishing-methods"></a>
After creating the dashboard in Tableau Desktop, I experimented with different methods to publish it for wider access :
- **Tableau Public** : Utilized Tableau Public, a free platform provided by Tableau, to publish the dashboard. This method offers simplicity and ease of integration since the dashboard is created in Tableau Desktop.
  
- **Embedding in Streamlit** : Explored embedding the Tableau Public dashboard within a Streamlit application running locally. This method aims to integrate the dashboard seamlessly into our project workflow.

- **Embedding in Google Sites** : Investigated embedding the Tableau Public dashboard into Google Sites, providing an alternative platform for sharing.

### Preferred Platform <a name="preferred-platform"></a>
Based on the evaluation of different publishing methods, Tableau Public emerged as the preferred platform for dashboard publishing. 

Since the dashboard is created in Tableau Desktop, integrating and publishing it on a platform provided by Tableau itself offers the most straightforward and feasible solution.

### Next Steps <a name="next-steps"></a>
Moving forward, we will:
- Refine the sample dashboard to align with project requirements.
- Collect and prepare actual project data for visualization.
- Explore more features and best practices in Tableau for more insightful visualizations.
- Collaborate and iterate on dashboard development to meet stakeholder needs effectively.
