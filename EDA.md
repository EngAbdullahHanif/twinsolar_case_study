# Energy Production Data Analysis

## Overview

The intention is to analyze energy production across different buildings through exploring data distributions, missing values, and correlations with energy production using visualizations and statistical methods.

An interactive report has been generated, offering insightful visualizations and analyses. 

This report can be opened in any web browser, providing a user-friendly interface to explore the data and gain valuable insights.

### Exploring the Distributions of the Variables

The section generates histograms or bar charts for numerical and categorical variables respectively. These visualizations show the distribution of values along with useful statistics like:

- Approximate Distinct Count
- Number of Missing Values
- Percentage of Missing Values

----

### Exploring Missing Values

This part provides detailed dataset statistics and visualizations to understand the data quality. 

Key statistics include:

- Number of Variables and Rows
- Number of Missing Cells
- Percentage of Missing Cells
- Duplicate Rows
- Memory Consumed
- Variable Types

Visualizations include bar charts, spectrum charts, and heat maps to depict the presence and absence of values across variables.


----

### Comparison of Distribution of Energy Production across Different Buildings

This section creates histograms for three buildings showing the distribution of energy production. 

These histograms are overlaid to visually compare the energy outputs across buildings.


----

### Exploring Correlations with the Target Energy Production

This part of the analysis identifies how different features correlate with energy production in three different buildings.
