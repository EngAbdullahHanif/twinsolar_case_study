## Business Story

#### Enhancing Microgrid Efficiency through Advanced Data Analytics and Machine Learning

##### Background:

Microgrids represent a revolutionary approach to energy management, offering a localized power system that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid. Introduced by Bob Lasseter in 2001, microgrids integrate various components such as Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), energy storage, and intelligent control systems to optimize energy production and consumption. In this project, we focus on the University of La Reunion's Terre Sainte campus, a grid-connected microgrid, that leverages solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to enhance energy sustainability and efficiency.

##### Objective:

The primary goal is to evaluate the potential of machine learning (ML) tools in predicting and optimizing the energy production and consumption within the Terre Sainte microgrid. This involves analyzing historical PV production data and weather data to develop predictive models that can forecast energy production and consumption patterns. The study aims to identify the key factors influencing PV production and optimize energy usage.

## Project Scope:

1. Data Collection and Management:
   • Gather historical data on PV production from buildings equipped with PV systems (ESIROI, ENERPOS, and Dpt 1_2).
   • Collect comprehensive weather data from the campus's weather station, including metrics such as Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Beam Normal Irradiance (BNI), temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.

2. Data Engineering and Cleaning:
   • Consolidate and preprocess the collected data to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   • Handle missing values, outliers, and discrepancies in the data through appropriate data-cleaning techniques.

3. Data Analysis and Modeling:
   • Use ML models to forecast PV production and energy demand based on historical data.
   • Perform comparative analysis using models that incorporate weather data versus those that do not, to determine the impact of weather on PV production.

4. Optimization and Insights:
   • Identify periods of high and low PV production and analyze the corresponding weather conditions.
   • Develop strategies to balance energy production and consumption, and minimize the gap between energy supply and demand.

Impact: Implementing advanced data analytics and ML techniques will provide valuable insights into the operation of the Terre Sainte microgrid. The outcomes will help in optimizing energy production, reducing operational costs, and enhancing the reliability and sustainability of the microgrid. This project will serve as a model for other microgrids aiming to integrate renewable energy sources effectively.
